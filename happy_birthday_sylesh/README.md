# Happy birthday Sylesh!

Crazy little piece of code I wrote for my cousin's birthday...can you figure out what it does without running it? And after you run it, can you figure out how it does what it does?

## Building

Building (and running tests) is as simple as:

```
$ make
```

## Running

After you've built the code, just run the `happy_birthday_sylesh` binary:

```
$ ./happy_birthday_sylesh
< SPOILER ALERT! >
```

## Hints

Check out the `hints/` subdirectory to view the code from most obfuscated to least obfuscated! Start with [0.c](https://github.com/pdsouza/koans/blob/master/happy_birthday_sylesh/hints/0.c) and work your way down--the last one should basically give it away!
