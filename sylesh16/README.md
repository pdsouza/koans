# sylesh16

Crazy little piece of code I wrote for my cousin's 16th birthday...can you figure out what it does without running it? And after you run it, can you figure out how it does what it does?

## Building

Building is as simple as:

    $ make


## Running

After you've built the code, just run the `happy_birthday_sylesh` binary:

```
$ ./happy_birthday_sylesh
< SPOILER ALERT! >
```
## Testing

Run a small testsuite with:

    $ make tests
    
Testing is critical when obfuscating otherwise it is a PITA to figure out when you messed something up.

## Hints
