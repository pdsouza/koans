# sylesh16

Crazy little piece of code I wrote for my cousin's 16th birthday...can you figure out what it does without running it? And after you run it, can you figure out how it does what it does?

## Building

Building (and running tests) is as simple as:

```
$ make
```

## Running

After you've built the code, just run the `happy_birthday_sylesh` binary:

```
$ ./happy_birthday_sylesh
< SPOILER ALERT! >
```
